Part 1:

Want to simplify the problem by associating each day with a guard ID,
and collecting all wake/sleep events into that day.

Then, I'll want to build up an array tracking minutes slept. It will be a size 60 array where each
index has either 1 or 0 depending if they slept that minute.

With this, I'll be able to group by guard ID, then just reduce the arrays with sum to count total
minutes slept. Once we know which guard we care about, we just add all of the arrays together
by index and count which index has the max. (the minute slept the most). Now we have the answer.


Parse: Input -> Event
